# SkillList
Proof of concept project written in Flask. 

## Intent
This project had the intent to show to my manager how a Flask app could simplify her tracking of call center employees and their skills.

My manager was manipulating a large spreadsheet containing skill and other information on a few hundred call center employees.  The task was arduous and time consuming because of sorting and filtering of so many rows as well as maintaining the right data.

The app would simplify the management of the data and the filtering of the data to get knowledge out of it.  The app did not make it past the proof of concept phase.  This was due mainly to internal barriers that my manager and I could not overcome.
